It's Week 2 of TechStart's second month. Sarah Chen has had a busy seven days:

1. A new client paid **$3,000** upfront for a consulting retainer
2. Sarah bought **$1,200** in new office equipment — paid with TechStart's cash
3. TechStart received a **$500** electricity bill (not yet paid)
4. A long-time client paid off their **$1,500** accounts receivable balance
5. Sarah made a **$200** payment toward the bank loan principal

At the end of the week, Sarah's bookkeeper asks: "Did the accounting equation stay balanced after all five of these?"

Sarah thinks for a moment. "I have no idea," she admits.

### Quick Case: The Coffee Bean Swap
If Sarah spends **$100** of her cash to buy **$100** worth of coffee beans, did her total Assets go **up**, **down**, or **stay the same**?

*Discuss with your partner. Does the "Equation Check" still pass?*

That's what this lesson fixes. By the end of today, you'll be able to trace exactly how each of these five events moves money between Assets, Liabilities, and Equity — and verify that the equation never breaks.`),

You just need the equation.',
        ),
        text(`## The Key Insight

Every business event touches **at least two places** in the accounting equation. This is called the **dual-impact** of transactions.

- Pay cash for equipment → Assets rearrange (Cash ↓, Equipment ↑) — no net change
- Borrow money from a bank → Assets ↑ AND Liabilities ↑
- Earn revenue in cash → Assets ↑ AND Equity ↑
- Pay an expense → Assets ↓ AND Equity ↓

The equation stays balanced because every change on one side is matched by a change somewhere else. Let's trace Sarah's five events.`),

        text(`## Introduction: The Dual-Impact Principle

Every business transaction changes at least two accounts in the accounting equation — this is the dual-impact principle, and it's why **A = L + E** always stays balanced.

Four patterns cover nearly every transaction you'll see: (1) one asset trades for another (rearranges A), (2) both A and L grow together (borrowing), (3) both A and L shrink together (paying off debt), (4) A and E grow together (earning revenue). The trickiest pattern: receiving an unpaid bill — L increases and E decreases, but A is unchanged. This is the **accrual principle**: expenses are recognized when incurred, not when cash is paid.

Today you'll trace five of TechStart's Week-2 transactions and verify that the equation stays balanced after every single one.`),
        text(`## How Events Move the Equation

When analyzing any business event, ask two questions:
1. **What did TechStart get or give up?** (This tells you which account changes)
2. **Where did it come from or go to?** (This tells you the other account)

Every answer maps to A, L, or E. And when you're done, both sides of **A = L + E** must still be equal.

### Event Analysis: TechStart's Five Week-2 Transactions

| # | Event | What Changes | Direction | Equation Check |
|---|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | Client pays $3,000 retainer upfront | Cash (Asset) ↑, Deferred Revenue (Liability) ↑ | +3,000 / +3,000 | ✅ Both sides ↑ equally |
| 2 | Buy $1,200 equipment with cash | Equipment (Asset) ↑, Cash (Asset) ↓ | +1,200 / -1,200 | ✅ Assets rearrange, no net change |
| 3 | Receive $500 electricity bill (unpaid) | Electricity Expense → reduces Equity ↓, Accounts Payable (Liability) ↑ | -500 / +500 | ✅ E ↓ balanced by L ↑ |
| 4 | Client pays $1,500 AR balance | Cash (Asset) ↑, Accounts Receivable (Asset) ↓ | +1,500 / -1,500 | ✅ Assets rearrange |
| 5 | Pay $200 on bank loan principal | Cash (Asset) ↓, Bank Loan (Liability) ↓ | -200 / -200 | ✅ Both sides ↓ equally |

**Key observation:** The equation balanced after every single event — even though each event moved money in completely different ways.`),
        text(`## Why Expenses Reduce Equity

Event 3 is the trickiest. When TechStart gets the electricity bill, no cash leaves yet. But the equation still changes:

- Accounts Payable ↑ $500 (Liability — TechStart now owes the utility company)
- Equity ↓ $500 (Expenses reduce the owner's stake — the cost came out of TechStart's "worth")

This is confusing at first because nothing seems to happen visibly. But the obligation to pay is real, and it reduces what belongs to Sarah. This is why recognizing expenses when they're *incurred* (not when they're *paid*) is a core accounting principle.

**Accrual concept in plain language:** If TechStart used the electricity this month, the cost belongs to this month — even if the bill arrives next week.`),

**Setup in Excel:**
1. Open your account table from Lesson 2 (or create a fresh one)
2. Add two new columns: **Event** and **Change ($)**
3. For each event below, add rows showing which accounts changed

Work through each event. For each one, identify:
- Which accounts change (name and category: A, L, or E)
- The direction and dollar amount (+/-)
- Whether the equation still balances after that event

| Event | Starting Point |
|---|---|
| **Event 1**: Client pays $3,000 retainer | Cash: $4,200; Deferred Revenue: $0 |
| **Event 2**: Buy $1,200 equipment | Cash reflects Event 1; Equipment: $2,400 |
| **Event 3**: Receive $500 electricity bill | AP: $450; Equity (Net Income): $340 |
| **Event 4**: Client pays $1,500 AR | AR: $1,500; Cash reflects Events 1+2 |
| **Event 5**: Pay $200 bank loan principal | Bank Loan: $3,000; Cash reflects all prior events |

Net change from Events 1–7: +$3,000 - $1,200 + $1,500 - $200 + $2,000 - $600 = **+$4,500**

Every class has the same two "aha moments" in this lesson:

**Surprise 1: Assets rearranging (Events 2 and 4)**
Many students expect that receiving cash or buying something must change the equation totals. But when you swap one asset for another (cash for equipment, AR for cash), the total Assets stays the same. The equation doesn't change — it just rearranges.

**Surprise 2: Expenses hitting Equity before cash moves**
Getting a bill doesn't feel like losing money. But the obligation is real, and it reduces TechStart's net worth immediately — even before the cash leaves. This is the *accrual* principle, and it's one of the most important ideas in accounting.

**Reflection prompt:** Pick one of the seven events from today. In three sentences, explain:
1. What happened in the event
2. Which two accounts changed
3. Why the equation stayed balanced`),

You've now classified accounts *and* traced how events affect them. In **Lesson 4**, you'll organize all this information into the most important financial statement: the **Balance Sheet**.

You'll learn:
- How to structure Assets into Current and Non-Current sections
- How to write labeled subtotals
- How to build TechStart's first real Balance Sheet from the data you've been tracking

**Before Lesson 4:** Review the account list from Lesson 2. You'll be mapping every account to a specific section of the Balance Sheet.`),
