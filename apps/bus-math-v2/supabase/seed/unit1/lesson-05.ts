Three days after sending her Balance Sheet to the angel investor, Sarah got a reply:

> *"Hi Sarah — I reviewed TechStart's Balance Sheet. I found three issues before I even reached the totals. Can you send a corrected version?"*

Sarah's stomach dropped. She had checked the math. Everything balanced. How were there three errors?

She opened her ledger and started looking. The investor had highlighted:

1. **Office Supplies ($310) listed under Liabilities** — it should be a Current Asset
2. **Accrued Wages ($600) missing entirely** — the payroll obligation wasn't recorded
3. **Retained Earnings showing -$180** — a negative equity balance that looked like the business was insolvent

Three different kinds of errors. Three different causes. All of them invisible until someone looked closely.

### Quick Case: Before You Fix It
Which of these three errors would make the Balance Sheet look *worst* to an investor — and why?

*Discuss with your partner. What does each error signal about TechStart's financial health?*`),

        text(`## The Three Categories of Ledger Errors

Before you can fix errors, you need to know what kind you're dealing with:

**Type 1 — Misclassification:** An account is put in the wrong category (e.g., Supplies under Liabilities instead of Assets). The balance is correct, but it's in the wrong bucket, so the equation still "balances" but tells the wrong story.

**Type 2 — Missing Entry:** A transaction happened but was never recorded. The ledger doesn't balance, or an obligation is invisible. Often caused by an invoice not being logged or a payroll entry being skipped.

**Type 3 — Negative Balance Error:** A balance shows a negative value in a category where it shouldn't be possible (e.g., Cash = -$200 or Retained Earnings = -$180 when the business has been profitable). Usually signals a missing entry or the wrong sign on a transaction.`),

        text(`## Introduction: Three Types of Ledger Errors

Ledger errors fall into three categories, each with a clear signature:

- **Misclassification errors** — the account exists and the balance is right, but it's in the wrong category (e.g., Office Supplies filed under Liabilities). The equation may still balance while telling the wrong story.
- **Missing entry errors** — a real transaction was never recorded, so the equation breaks. Identify it when A ≠ L + E.
- **Negative balance errors** — almost always signal a sign error in a prior entry (a debit where a credit belongs, or vice versa).

Excel's **Conditional Formatting** lets you build automatic red-flag rules that highlight these problems instantly. Today you'll build three rules on TechStart's ledger and use them to find and fix every error in the dataset.`),
        text(`## Building Red-Flag Rules in Excel

**Conditional Formatting** highlights cells automatically based on rules you set. Here's how to create the three most useful error-detection rules for a ledger:

### Rule 1: Blank Category = Error
**Trigger:** Any row in the Category column that's empty
**Action:** Fill cell with red

1. Select the Category column range (e.g., C2:C20)
2. Home → Conditional Formatting → New Rule
3. "Format only cells that contain" → "Blanks"
4. Format → Fill → Red → OK

**What it catches:** Accounts that were added to the ledger but never classified.

---

### Rule 2: Negative Asset Balance = Warning
**Trigger:** Row has Category = "A" AND balance < 0
**Action:** Fill cell with orange

1. Select the Balance column range (e.g., B2:B20)
2. New Rule → "Use a formula"
3. Formula: \`=AND($C2="A",$B2<0)\`
4. Format → Fill → Orange → OK

**What it catches:** Asset accounts with impossible negative values (e.g., Cash = -$200).

---

### Rule 3: Liability with Suspiciously High Balance
**Trigger:** Row has Category = "L" AND balance > a threshold (e.g., $10,000)
**Action:** Fill cell with yellow

1. Select Balance column range
2. New Rule → "Use a formula"
3. Formula: \`=AND($C2="L",$B2>10000)\`
4. Format → Fill → Yellow → OK

**What it catches:** Liabilities that seem disproportionately large relative to TechStart's scale.`),

Sarah's ledger below contains errors. Your job:
1. Set up the three Conditional Formatting rules from the Introduction
2. Run the rules against this dataset — some cells should turn red or orange
3. Identify each error and write the correction

| Account | Balance | Category | Flag? |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Cash | $3,800 | A | |

| Sarah's Capital | $5,000 | E | |

Fix: Change Category from "L" to "A".

**Retained Earnings = -$180:**
Error type: **Negative Balance / Missing Entry**
Retained Earnings should reflect accumulated profits. A negative balance would mean TechStart lost more than it ever earned — but that contradicts the Current Net Income of $540 and prior period activity.
Diagnosis: A prior-period expense was likely recorded twice, or a revenue entry was entered with the wrong sign.
Fix: Investigate the prior entries. Correct the sign error. Retained Earnings should be positive (~$960 from Lesson 2 close).`),

2. **What would have happened if Sarah sent the original ledger to the investor?** Which error would have looked worst?

TechStart's Month 3 ledger has been submitted for your review. It contains multiple errors of different types. Work independently to find and fix all of them.

|---------|---------|----------|

**Instructions:**
1. Copy this data into Excel
2. Apply all three Conditional Formatting rules
3. Identify every error (there are at least three)
4. Write the corrected row for each error
5. Verify: after corrections, do Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Equity?

**Hint about Accumulated Depreciation:** This is a real accounting account. It has a negative balance by design — it represents the portion of Office Equipment that has been "used up" over time. However, it should be listed under Assets (as a negative contra-asset), not as a standalone asset with a positive balance. Think about whether this entry is correct or needs correction.`),

Every class has the same three errors they miss most often:

**Missed Error 1: Prepaid accounts in Liabilities**
Students see "prepaid" and think "I haven't used it yet, so I still owe something." But TechStart paid *first* — the coverage is coming TO TechStart, not FROM it. Future benefit = Asset.

**Missed Error 2: Negative balances assumed to be correct**
"The formula produced -$180 so it must be right." Negative Asset and sometimes negative Equity balances are almost always a sign of a sign error somewhere upstream. When you see a negative where it shouldn't be, hunt for the cause instead of accepting it.

**Missed Error 3: Missing entries that still "balance"**
If Accrued Wages is missing but both an expense and a liability were accidentally omitted equally, the equation can still balance. Conditional Formatting won't catch this because the equation checks out. The only way to find this class of error is to reconcile transactions against source documents.

**Reflection prompt:** Think about the errors in today's dataset. In two sentences, describe the process you'd follow if you received a ledger from a business partner and needed to verify it was error-free. What would you check first?`),
        text(`## What's Coming in Lesson 6

Your error-detection skills are sharp. In **Lesson 6**, you'll add a layer of defense: *data validation*.

Instead of finding errors after they happen, you'll prevent them from being entered in the first place. Excel's Data Validation tool can force the Category column to only accept "A", "L", or "E" — blocking misclassifications before they occur.

**Before Lesson 6:** Keep your corrected Month 3 ledger. You'll use it as the starting dataset for building validation rules.`),
