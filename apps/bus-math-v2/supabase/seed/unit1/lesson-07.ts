Lesson 7 is the **whole-class guided build** for Unit 1. Before groups branch into differentiated project data, everyone uses the same scaffolded workbook, \`unit_01_balance_snapshot_guided.xlsx\`, and the same shared dataset, \`unit_01_class_snapshot_dataset.csv\`.

Sarah is about to show her banker a one-page picture of TechStart's financial position. The class will build that product together first so every student understands the non-negotiable structure before Lesson 8 introduces six different datasets.

### Quick Case: The Visual Question
If you were looking at TechStart's financial position for the first time, what would a bar chart of Assets vs. Liabilities tell you that the numbers alone would hide?

*Discuss with a partner. What does visual proportion communicate that raw rows do not?*`),

        ),
        text(`## What the Shared Build Includes

The class product has two anchor assets:

- \`unit_01_balance_snapshot_guided.xlsx\` for the scaffolded workbook structure
- \`unit_01_class_snapshot_dataset.csv\` for the common TechStart case

The build also uses:

- \`unit_01_foundational_build_guide.pdf\` for the essential completion moves
- \`unit_01_polish_guide.pdf\` for audience-ready quality moves

A Balance Snapshot is a two-part document:

**Part 1 — The Balance Sheet (left column or top section)**
- TechStart's name, "Balance Sheet," and current date as of header
- Three sections: Assets (Current + Non-Current), Liabilities (Current + Non-Current), Equity
- Subtotals at each level
- Grand totals: TOTAL ASSETS and TOTAL LIABILITIES + EQUITY (must match)
- Clean formatting: bold headers, indented accounts, Accounting number format, double underline for final totals

**Part 2 — The Bar Chart (right column or bottom section)**
- Title: "TechStart Financial Position — [Date]"
- Two bars: one for Total Assets, one for Total Liabilities
- Y-axis: dollar amounts
- Data labels on each bar showing the exact total
- A note below the chart: "Equity = $[Total Equity]" — the gap between the two bars

The visual purpose: if the Assets bar is taller than the Liabilities bar, TechStart has positive equity. The larger the gap, the healthier the business.`),

In this lesson every student completes the same guided workbook so the class can rehearse the full Unit 1 process together.

The **polish guide** in \`unit_01_polish_guide.pdf\` shows what advanced-quality communication looks like once the workbook is correct.

You'll still build the two-bar chart comparing Total Assets to Total Liabilities, but the bigger point is to internalize the common project sequence before Lesson 8 gives each group a new dataset.`),
        text(`## The Guided Build Walkthrough

### Step 1: Create a Summary Table

Somewhere below your Balance Sheet data, create a small table:

| Label | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Total Assets | =[cell with Total Assets formula] |
| Total Liabilities | =[cell with Total Liabilities formula] |

Use cell references — don't type the numbers. This way the chart updates automatically if your data changes.

### Step 2: Insert the Column Chart

1. Select the two value cells (not the labels)
2. Insert tab → Charts → 2-D Column Chart
3. Excel creates a two-bar chart

### Step 3: Format the Chart

1. Click the chart title → rename to: **TechStart Financial Position — [Date]**
2. Click a bar → right-click → Add Data Labels
3. Click the Legend → Delete (the bars are self-explanatory)
4. Resize the chart to fit neatly next to your Balance Sheet

### Step 4: Foundational Completion

Use \`unit_01_foundational_build_guide.pdf\` to verify the non-negotiables:
- the Balance Sheet sections are complete
- totals reconcile to the accounting equation
- the chart uses linked values rather than typed numbers

### Step 5: Print Layout

1. Page Layout tab → Orientation: **Landscape**
2. Margins: **Narrow**
3. Scale: Fit to **1 page**
4. Add a header: *TechStart Solutions | Balance Snapshot v0.9*
5. File → Print Preview — confirm the layout looks professional

### Step 6: Advanced Polish

Use \`unit_01_polish_guide.pdf\` to add chart labels, layout hierarchy, and audience-facing notes.

Below the chart (or in a text box), add:

> *TechStart Equity: $[amount] — [Date]*

This contextualizes the gap between the bars for anyone who reads the document.`),

        text(`## Class Build: Chart on TechStart Month 3 Data

Use TechStart's Month 3 validated ledger from Lesson 6. Work through the chart-building steps together.

**TechStart Month 3 Summary (for chart input):**

| Account Section | Total |
|----------------|-------|
| Total Current Assets | $8,660 |
| Total Non-Current Assets | $3,300 (Equipment $3,600 − Depreciation $300) |
| **Total Assets** | **$11,960** |
| Total Current Liabilities | $3,630 |
| Total Non-Current Liabilities | $2,600 |
| **Total Liabilities** | **$6,230** |
| **Total Equity** | **$5,730** |

**Verification check:** $11,960 = $6,230 + $5,730 ✅

Use these totals to build your chart. Your two bars should be:
- Total Assets: **$11,960** (taller bar)
- Total Liabilities: **$6,230** (shorter bar)

The gap of $5,730 is TechStart's equity — the owner's stake.`),
        callout('tip', `**Reading the Chart**

When the Assets bar is taller than the Liabilities bar, TechStart has positive equity. The taller the gap, the more of the business Sarah truly owns versus how much is financed by creditors.

If the bars were equal: Equity = $0. Sarah would own nothing.
If the Liabilities bar were taller: Negative equity. Creditors have a stronger claim on TechStart than Sarah does.

This is why lenders and investors look at the chart before the numbers. Proportions tell the story faster than a table.`),

- [ ] Correct title: "TechStart Financial Position — [Date]"
- [ ] Two bars with the right labels and heights
- [ ] Data labels showing dollar amounts on each bar
- [ ] No legend (unnecessary for a two-variable chart)

- You can classify accounts correctly (Lessons 1–2)
- You understand how transactions change the equation (Lesson 3)
- You can organize accounts into a formal Balance Sheet (Lesson 4)
- You can detect and fix ledger errors (Lesson 5)
- You can validate data for consistency (Lesson 6)
- You can communicate financial position visually (Lesson 7)
