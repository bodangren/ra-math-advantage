Sarah spent two hours cleaning last month's ledger errors. She sent the corrected file to her accountant for review.

The reply came back in 20 minutes:

> *"Sarah — I can't import this into our accounting software. The Category column has five different spellings for 'Asset': 'A', 'Asset', 'asset', 'ASSET', and 'Asst'. Our system only accepts standardized entries. Please resubmit with consistent values."*

Sarah had spent time fixing misclassifications. She hadn't thought about *how* the values were typed.

The issue wasn't the accounting logic. It was the data quality. And data quality problems are preventable.

### Quick Scenario: One Rule That Stops the Problem
If the Category column could only accept "A", "L", or "E" — and nothing else — how would that change what happened?

*Discuss with your partner. What are the advantages and disadvantages of restricting what can be typed into a cell?*`),

        text(`## What Data Validation Does

**Data Validation** is an Excel feature that controls what can be entered into a cell. You set the rules; Excel enforces them.

Three validation rules TechStart will use this lesson:

1. **Dropdown list for Category:** Only "A", "L", or "E" can be entered — no typos, no variations
2. **No blank allowed:** Any required field (Account Name, Balance, Category) must have a value
3. **Positive number for Balance:** The Balance column can only accept numbers ≥ 0 for standard accounts

These three rules together make TechStart's ledger *machine-readable* — ready for import into accounting software, analysis with formulas, or sharing with a bookkeeper.`),

        text(`## Introduction: Preventing Errors Before They Happen

In Lesson 5 you learned to **detect** errors after the fact. In this lesson you'll **prevent** them at the source using Excel's Data Validation tool.

Data Validation restricts what can be entered into any cell. With a **Stop** error alert, Excel rejects any value that breaks your rule — no saving, no workarounds. Today you'll build three rules on TechStart's ledger: (1) a Category dropdown limited to A, L, or E; (2) no-blank rules for required fields; and (3) a positive-balance constraint. You'll verify each rule by trying to enter invalid data — if Excel stops you, it works.`),
        text(`## Setting Up the Rules: Step by Step

### Rule 1: Category Dropdown List

1. Select the Category column range (e.g., C2:C30)
2. Data tab → Data Validation → Data Validation
3. Under "Allow" → select **List**
4. Under "Source" → type: \`A,L,E\`
5. Check "In-cell dropdown"
6. Click the **Error Alert** tab → set Style to **Stop**, write a message: *"Category must be A, L, or E."*
7. Click OK

**Test it:** Try typing "Asset" into a Category cell. Excel should reject it.

---

### Rule 2: No Blank Account Names

1. Select the Account Name column range (e.g., A2:A30)
2. Data Validation → Allow: **Custom**
3. Formula: \`=NOT(ISBLANK(A2))\`
4. Error Alert → Stop: *"Account Name cannot be blank."*
5. Click OK

**Test it:** Try to leave an Account Name cell empty and move to the next cell.

---

### Rule 3: Non-Negative Balance

1. Select the Balance column range (e.g., B2:B30)
2. Data Validation → Allow: **Decimal** → Data: **greater than or equal to** → Minimum: **0**
3. Error Alert → Stop: *"Balance must be a non-negative number."*
4. Click OK

**Test it:** Try typing -500 into a Balance cell.`),

Use TechStart's corrected Month 3 ledger from Lesson 5. Set up all three validation rules on the existing data.

**Before setting up rules — check for existing data issues:**

Review each row in the Category column. Look for any values that aren't exactly "A", "L", or "E". If you find inconsistencies, fix them now before activating the dropdown rule.

| Account | Balance | Category |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Cash | $5,100 | A |
| Accounts Receivable | $1,800 | A |
| Office Supplies | $220 | A |
| Prepaid Rent | $600 | A |

| Bank Loan | $2,600 | L |
| Sarah's Capital | $5,000 | E |
| Retained Earnings | $1,140 | E |
| Current Net Income | $750 | E |

**Note on Accumulated Depreciation:** This account has a negative balance by design. It's a contra-asset — it reduces the reported value of Office Equipment. For this exercise, you'll need to either exclude it from the non-negative balance rule OR set a separate exception for this row.`),
        callout('tip', `**Handling Accumulated Depreciation in Validation**

The non-negative balance rule will flag Accumulated Depreciation as invalid. Here are two ways to handle it:

**Option A (Simple):** Exclude the Depreciation row from the Balance validation range — apply the non-negative rule to B2:B12, skipping the depreciation row at B6.

**Option B (Advanced):** Use a Custom formula that allows negatives only for contra-asset accounts: \`=OR(AND($C2="A",$A2<>"Accumulated Depreciation"),$B2>=0)\`

For this lesson, Option A is recommended.`),

Sarah received a ledger from her part-time bookkeeper. It has multiple data quality issues — inconsistent category entries, blank fields, and invalid balances. Your job: clean it so it passes all three validation rules.

**Dirty Ledger (from the bookkeeper):**

| Account | Balance | Category |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Cash | $4,200 | Asset |
| Office Equipment | | A |
| Accounts Receivable | $1,500 | a |

**Instructions:**
1. Copy this data into Excel
2. Identify every data quality issue
3. Fix each issue so the data would pass all three validation rules
4. Set up the validation rules on your cleaned data
5. Verify: no cells are rejected, no blanks remain, all categories are A/L/E

| 1 | ? | ? |

After cleaning and applying validation rules, run this checklist:

- [ ] **Zero blank Balances** — every row has a dollar value
- [ ] **All Categories are exactly A, L, or E** — no other values accepted
- [ ] **All standard balances ≥ 0** — exception granted for Accumulated Depreciation only
- [ ] **Equation check passes** — Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Equity

If all five items are checked, your ledger is validation-complete. It's ready to share with an accountant, import into software, or use as the foundation for your Balance Snapshot in Lesson 7.

**Share-out:** Present one issue you found and fixed to your partner. Explain what type of problem it was and how your validation rule would prevent it in the future.`),

Before Lesson 6, if someone asked you "Is this ledger accurate?", you'd have to check every row manually.

After Lesson 6, a ledger with validation rules has a built-in answer: if no validation errors are highlighted, the data meets its own quality standards.

That's not a guarantee of accuracy — validation can't catch a correctly entered wrong number. But it *does* eliminate an entire category of errors: the messy, inconsistent human errors that come from typing freely into a shared spreadsheet.

**What validation DOES catch:**
- Typos in the Category column ("Assset", "LIABILITY")
- Missing entries in required fields
- Impossible numeric values in controlled ranges

**What validation CANNOT catch:**
- A correctly formatted wrong amount ($4,200 instead of $2,400)
- An account that's classified correctly but shouldn't exist at all
- Revenue that was never invoiced

**Reflection prompt:** You've now built two layers of error defense: Conditional Formatting (Lesson 5) to catch errors after they occur, and Data Validation (Lesson 6) to prevent errors before they occur. In two sentences, explain how these two tools complement each other.`),
        text(`## What's Coming in Lesson 7

Your ledger is clean and validated. In **Lesson 7**, you'll turn that data into TechStart's most important deliverable so far: the **Balance Snapshot**.

The Balance Snapshot combines a structured Balance Sheet with a simple bar chart comparing Assets to Liabilities. It's the document that Sarah will present to the classroom — and the foundation for your first unit milestone.

**Before Lesson 7:** Make sure your validated ledger from today is saved and accessible. You'll use the account balances directly in your Balance Snapshot.`),
