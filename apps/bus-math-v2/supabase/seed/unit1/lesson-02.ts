Sarah ran her first Balance Sheet report on Friday afternoon. She expected to feel proud — TechStart had a great month. Instead, she stared at a number that made no sense.

Total Assets: **$9,410**
Total Liabilities + Equity: **$7,960**

The difference? **$1,450.** The equation didn't balance. But she hadn't spent any money she didn't track — so where did $1,450 go?

After an hour of searching, she found it. Two accounts were in the wrong category:
- **Prepaid Insurance** ($350): listed under Liabilities instead of Assets
- **Deferred Revenue** ($1,100): listed under Assets instead of Liabilities

One mix-up. Two accounts. A $1,450 error that made her entire report untrustworthy.

This is why account classification matters — not just for getting an A, but for making decisions you can actually trust.`),

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to look at any business account and correctly answer: "Is this an Asset, a Liability, or Equity?"

You'll also learn to handle the tricky "gray zone" accounts that trip up even experienced bookkeepers.

### Quick Case: The Uncle's Loan
Sarah's Uncle lent her **$5,000** to start TechStart. Is this $5,000 something Sarah **OWNS** or something she **OWES**?

        text(`## Introduction: The Three-Question Classification Test

Every account in TechStart's ledger belongs to exactly one of three categories. Apply these three questions in order — the first "yes" determines the category:

1. Does TechStart **own or control it** with future economic value? → **Asset**
2. Does TechStart **owe it** to someone else? → **Liability**
3. Is it the **owner's stake** — original investment or accumulated profit? → **Equity**

The trickiest accounts are "gray zone" accounts that seem to fit two categories. **Prepaid Insurance** is an Asset because TechStart still owns unused coverage. **Deferred Revenue** is a Liability because TechStart owes the client a future service. The rule: ask *who has a claim* — if TechStart can use it freely, it's an Asset; if someone else can demand it back or demand delivery, it's a Liability.`),
        text(`## The Classification Test

Before you can sort accounts, you need a reliable test. Use these three questions in order:

**1. Does TechStart own or control it, and does it have future value?**
→ If yes → **Asset**

**2. Does TechStart owe it to someone else?**
→ If yes → **Liability**

**3. Is it the owner's stake (investment or accumulated profit)?**
→ If yes → **Equity**

Every account passes exactly one of these tests. If you're unsure, work through all three before deciding.

### Assets — What TechStart Owns

| Account | Why It's an Asset |
|---------|------------------|
| Cash | TechStart controls it; can spend it anytime |
| Laptops | Equipment TechStart owns and uses |
| Accounts Receivable | Money clients owe TechStart — TechStart controls the future payment |
| Prepaid Insurance | TechStart paid for 6 months of coverage; it has future value |
| Office Supplies | TechStart owns them; they'll be used in operations |

### Liabilities — What TechStart Owes

| Account | Why It's a Liability |
|---------|---------------------|
| Bank Loan | TechStart must repay the principal |
| Accounts Payable | Vendor invoices TechStart hasn't paid yet |
| Credit Card Balance | TechStart charged it; must pay it off |
| Deferred Revenue | Client paid in advance; TechStart owes the service |
| Accrued Wages | Employees earned it; TechStart must pay |

### Equity — What's Left for the Owner

| Account | Why It's Equity |
|---------|----------------|
| Sarah's Capital | Her original investment in TechStart |
| Retained Earnings | Profits kept in the business from prior periods |
| Current Month Net Income | This period's profit (before closing to retained earnings) |`),

          'example',
          `**Worked Example: Prepaid Insurance vs. Deferred Revenue**

If TechStart has already paid for six months of insurance, that future coverage is still an **Asset** because the business can use it later.

If a client has paid TechStart in advance for work that has not been delivered yet, that obligation is a **Liability** because the service is still owed.

The account name alone is not enough. Ask who still has the claim.`,
        ),
        text(`## The Gray Zone: Tricky Accounts

Some accounts look like they could go two ways. Here's how to handle the most common ones:

**Prepaid Expenses** (e.g., Prepaid Insurance, Prepaid Rent)
→ **Asset.** TechStart paid cash but hasn't used the benefit yet. The future benefit is the asset.

**Deferred Revenue** (e.g., a client pays for 3 months of consulting upfront)
→ **Liability.** TechStart received the cash but hasn't done the work. The obligation to deliver is the liability.

**Accrued Wages**
→ **Liability.** Employees worked; TechStart owes the payroll but hasn't paid yet.

**Owner Drawings / Withdrawals**
→ **Reduces Equity.** When Sarah takes money out for personal use, it lowers her equity stake.

**Memory trick:** If someone else can knock on TechStart's door and demand something, it's probably a Liability. If TechStart can walk in the door and use it, it's probably an Asset.`),

Sarah exported her account list as a CSV file. Your first job in real accounting work is turning raw data into a usable Table.

**Follow these steps in Excel:**

1. Open the CSV file (or paste the data below into a blank sheet)
2. Select any cell inside the data range
3. Press **Ctrl + T** (Windows) or **Cmd + T** (Mac) to create a Table
4. Check "My table has headers" and click OK

Now work on your own. Sarah has added three new accounts from this week's activity. Classify each one and add it to your Excel Table.

| New Account | Balance | Your Classification |
|---|---|---|
| Office Supplies | $310 | ? |
| Credit Card Balance | $200 | ? |
| Sarah's Drawings | $500 | ? |

**Steps:**
1. Add these three rows to your Excel Table
2. Classify each in the Category column
3. Calculate totals for each category using a SUMIF formula:
   - \`=SUMIF([Category],"A",[Balance])\` → Total Assets
   - \`=SUMIF([Category],"L",[Balance])\` → Total Liabilities
   - \`=SUMIF([Category],"E",[Balance])\` → Total Equity

1. **Check your totals.** Do Assets = Liabilities + Equity? If not, hunt for the misclassified account.

3. **Prepare one sentence** explaining the hardest account you classified. You'll use this in today's reflection.

You've classified 14 accounts today. The ones students most often get wrong:

| Account | Common Mistake | Why It's Actually... |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| Prepaid Insurance | Listed as Liability ("we paid the insurer, so we owe them") | **Asset** — we've already paid; the future coverage belongs to us |
| Deferred Revenue | Listed as Asset ("we have the cash!") | **Liability** — we owe the client their service |
| Owner Drawings | Listed as Expense ("Sarah spent money") | **Reduces Equity** — it's not an operating cost; it's the owner reclaiming her stake |

The trick: don't ask "did money move in or out?" Ask "who has a claim on this?"

You can now classify accounts. Next, you'll see what happens to those classifications **when business events occur**.

In **Lesson 3**, TechStart has five new transactions — and for each one, you'll track which category goes up and which goes down, without worrying about debits or credits yet.

**Before Lesson 3:** Make sure you can explain the gray zone accounts without looking at your notes. The dual-impact concept in Lesson 3 builds directly on today's classification skill.`),
