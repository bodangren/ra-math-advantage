Use the conductor skill to implement one phase of a track.

Step 1: Load Context. Read `conductor/current_directive.md`, `conductor/tech-debt.md`, `conductor/lessons-learned.md`, `conductor/tracks.md`.

Step 2: Resume or Plan.
- If there is an `[~] In Progress` phase, finish it. Do not start a new phase.
- If no incomplete phases, define exactly ONE new track serving `current_directive.md`. Create track artifacts.

2.1 Review the work in the previous phase and check-fix before moving onto the new phase in step 3. 

Step 3: Implement a SINGLE PHASE autonomously with TDD (Red-Green-Refactor). Use appropriate skills for all implementation.
- For each task: attach git notes per conductor protocol, merge changes, and push.

Step 4: Verify. Run full test suite, run build, correct any build errors.

Step 5: Finalize.
- Update `tech-debt.md` and `lessons-learned.md`. If either exceeds 50 lines, trim aggressively to get back under budget.
- Commit with a note and push phase checkpoint. Put your model name in the commit subject line.
CRITICAL:
1. All shell commands MUST use non-interactive flags (--yes, --no-interactive, etc.). Unattended run only.
2. DO NOT ask the user any questions or for any intervention. This is an autonomous run.
3. Respect the case of file paths. This is a unix system and case matters.
4. Do not create or work on tracks marked DEFERRED in tracks.md. If a track is marked [x] in tracks.md, treat it as complete even if its plan.md has pending tasks.
